Hello, my name is Yash Bingi! I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in Computer Science as a part of the Turing Scholars honors program. 
In my free time, I love to play soccer, work out, listen to music, and explore the city of Austin! Academically, I have done research in the field of machine learning 
and public health, creating models that can advance medicine and make the landscape of public health more equitable around the world. Feel free to reach out to me, my email 
is yashbingi@utexas.edu!
